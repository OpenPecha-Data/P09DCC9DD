If the aggregates were self, it would be possessed of arising and decaying. If it were other
than the aggregates, it would not have the characteristics of the aggregates.

If the self did not exist, where could what is mine exist? In order to pacify self and what
is mine, grasping I and grasping mine can exist no more.

The one who does not grasp at me and mine likewise does not exist. Whoever sees the one who
does not grasp at me and mine does not see.

When one ceases thinking of inner and outer things as self and mine, clinging will come to a
stop. Through that ceasing, birth will cease.

Through the ceasing of action and affliction, there is freedom. Action and affliction [come]
from thoughts and they from fixations. Fixations are stopped by emptiness.

It is said that “there is a self,” but “non-self” too is taught. The buddhas also teach there
is nothing which is “neither self nor non-self.”

That to which language refers is denied, because an object experienced by the mind is denied.
The unborn and unceasing nature of reality is comparable to nirvana.

Everything is real, not real; both real and not real; neither not real nor real: this is the
teaching of the Buddha.

Not known through others, peaceful, not fixed by fixations, without conceptual thought, without
differentiation: these are the characteristics of suchness.

Whatever arises dependent on something else is at that time neither that very thing nor other
than it. Hence it is neither severed nor permanent.

That ambrosial teaching of the buddhas, those guardians of the world, is neither the same nor
different, neither severed nor permanent.

When perfect buddhas do not appear, and when their disciples have died out, the wisdom of the
self-awakened ones will vividly arise without reliance.
