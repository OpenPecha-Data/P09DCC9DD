If the present and the future were contingent on the past, then the present and the future would
have existed in the past.

If the present and future did not exist there, then how could the present and the future be
contingent on it?

Without being contingent on the past neither can be established. Hence the present and the future
times also do not exist.

These very stages can be applied to the other two. Superior, inferior, middling etc., singularity
and so on can also be understood [thus].

Non-dwelling time cannot be apprehended. Since time which can be apprehended, does not exist
as something which dwells, how can one talk of unapprehendable time?

If time depended on things, where would time which is a non-thing exist? If there were no things
at all, where would a view of time exist?
