Investigation of the Sense OrgansSeeing and hearing and smelling and tasting and touching, mind
are the six sense organs; their experienced objects are what-is-seen and so forth.

Seeing does not see itself. How can what does not see itself see anything else?

The example of fire is not able to fully establish seeing. It, along with seeing, has been refuted
by “gone”, “not gone” and “going.”

When not seeing the slightest thing, there is no act of seeing. How can it [then] be reasonable
to say: “seeing sees”?

Seeing does not see; non-seeing does not see. It should be understood that seeing explains the
seer too.

Without letting go of [seeing] a seer does not exist; in letting go of seeing, there is also
[no seer]. If there is no seer, where can there be what-is-seen and seeing?

Just as it is said that a child emerges in dependence on a father and a mother, likewise it
is said that consciousness emerges in dependence upon an eye and a visual form.

Because there is no what-is-seen and no seeing, the four such as consciousness do not exist.
How can clinging etc. exist?

It should be understood that seeing explains hearing and smelling and tasting and touching,
mind, hearer, what is heard, etc.
