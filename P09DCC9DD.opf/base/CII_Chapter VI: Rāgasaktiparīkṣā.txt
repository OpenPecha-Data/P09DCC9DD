Investigation of Desire and the Desirous OneIf a desirous one without desire exists before desire,
desire would exist dependent on that [desirous one]. [When] a desirous one exists,
desire exists.

If there were no desirous one, how could there be desire? The same follows for the desirous
one too: [it depends on] whether desire exists or not.

It is not reasonable for desire and the desirous one to arise as co-existent. In this way desire
and the desirous one would not be mutually contingent.

Identity has no co-existence: something cannot be co-existent with itself. If there were difference,
how could there be co-existence?

If the identical were co-existent, [co-existence] would also occur between the unrelated; if
the different were co-existent, [co-existence] would also occur between the unrelated.

If the different were co-existent, how would desire and the desirous one be established as different
or, if that were so, [how would] those two be co-existent?

If desire and the desirous were established as different, because of what could one understand
them as co-existent?

If one asserts them to be co-existent because they are not established as different, then because
they would be very much established as co-existent, would one not also have to assert
them to be different?

Since different things are not established, co-existent things are not established. If there
existed any different things, one could assert them as co-existent things.

In that way, desire and the desirous one are not established as co-existent or not co-existent.
Like desire, all phenomena are not established as co-existent or not co-existent.
