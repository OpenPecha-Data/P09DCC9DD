The Bhagavan said that whatever dharma is deceptive, that is false. All conditions [are] deceptive
dharmas, thus they are false.

If whatever is a deceptive phenomenon is false, what is deceptive about it [in what way is it
deceptive]? That statement by the Bhagavan is a complete presentation of emptiness.

Things have no essential nature because they are seen to change into something else. Things
do not lack an essential nature because things are emptiness.

If there were no essential nature, whose [nature] would it be to change into something else?
If there were an essential nature, how would it be possible to change into something else?

This itself does not change into something else. The other itself too does not [either]. Because
youth does not age. Because age too does not age.

If this itself changes into something else, milk itself would be curds. Something other than
milk would be the being of curds.

If a bit of the non-empty existed, a bit of the empty would also exist. If there did not exist
a bit of the non-empty, how could the empty exist?

The Conquerors taught emptiness as the forsaking of all views. Those who view emptiness are
taught to be without realisation [incurable/incorrigible].
