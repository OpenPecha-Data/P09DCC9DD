Not the aggregates, not other than the aggregates; the aggregates are not in him; he is not
in them: the Tathagata does not possess the aggregates. What is the Tathagata?

If the buddha depends on the aggregates, he does not exist from an own-nature. How can that
which does not exist from an own-nature exist from an other-nature?

It is not tenable for something dependent on other-nature to be self-existent. How can that
which has no self-existence be tathagata?

If self-nature does not exist, how can there be the existence of other-nature? What is a Tathagata
apart from own-nature and other-nature?

If there exists a tathagata [who is] not depending on the aggregates, he exists in depending
[on them] now and will henceforth depend.

If there does not exist a tathagata [who is]not depending on the aggregates, how does he grasp
[depend on? them]?

[Since] there is nothing to be grasped/dependent on, there can be no grasping/depending. There
is no tathagata at all who is without grasping/depending.

If having examined in five ways, how can that tathagata who does not exist as that one or the
other be [conventionally] understood by grasping/depending?

That which is grasped/depended on does not exist from its own nature. It is impossible for that
which does not exist from its own nature to exist from another nature.

In that way, what is grasped/depended on and what grasps/depends are empty in every aspect.
How can an empty tathagata be [conventionally] understood by what is empty?

Do not say “empty,” or “not empty,” or “both,” or “neither:” these are mentioned for the sake
of [conventional] understanding.

Where can the four such as permanence and impermanence exist in this peaceful one? Where can
the four such as end and no-end [of the world] exist in this peaceful one?

Those who hold the dense apprehension, “the tathagata exists” conceive the thought, “he does
not exist in nirvana.”

For that one empty of own-nature, it is entirely inappropriate to think that once the buddha
has nirvana-ed he either “exists” or “does not exist.”

Those who make fixations about Buddha who is beyond fixations and without deterioration -- all
those who are damaged by fixations do not see the tathagata.

Whatever is the own-nature of the tathagata, that is the own-nature of this world. The tathagata
has no own-nature. This world has no own-nature.
