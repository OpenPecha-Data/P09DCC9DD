Investigation of Coming and GoingThen there is no going in what has gone; there is no going
also in what has not [yet] gone. Motion is unknowable apart from what has gone and not [yet]
gone.

Where there is moving, there there is going. Furthermore, because moving is within motion --
and is neither gone nor not [yet] gone, therefore, there is going within motion.

How can going be possible within motion? Because motion that is not going is impossible.

For whomever there is going within motion, for him it will follow that there [could be] no going
within motion, because there is going within motion. (Or, following the structure and
wording of v. 10: “To claim that there is going within motion implies that there could be
no going within motion, because it is asserted there is going within motion.”)

If there were going within motion, it would follow that going would be twofold: that by which
one becomes someone in motion [in a place] and [that by which one] goes in that [place].

If going were twofold, the goer also would be twofold, because going is impossible without a
goer.

If there were no goer, going would be impossible. If there were no going, where could a goer
be existent?

When a goer does not go, a non-goer cannot go; what third one other than a goer and a non-goer
could go?

When a goer is impossible without going, then how is it possible to say: “a goer goes”?

To claim that a goer goes implies that there could be a goer who does not go, because it is
asserted that a goer goes.

If the goer goes, it would follow that going would be twofold: that which reveals* the goer
and that which goes once [he] has become a goer.

If a beginning of going does not exist in what has gone, [if] a beginning of going does not
exist also in what has not [yet] gone [and if] there does not exist a beginning within motion,
wherein is a beginning of going made?

Before a beginning of going, there is not any motion or anything which has gone wherein going
could begin. How can going exist in what has not [yet] gone?

If a beginning of going is simply not apparent in any way, examine: what has gone? what is motion?
what has not [yet] gone?

When a goer does not stay, a non-goer cannot stay; what third one other than a goer and a non-goer
could stay?

When a goer is not possible without going, how then is it possible [to say]: “a goer stays.”

There is no reversal of motion*, nor also of what has gone [and] what has not [yet] gone. [Reversal
of] going, engagement [to stay] and reversal [of staying] are similar to going.

It is inappropriate to say: “going and a goer are the same.” It is inappropriate to say: “going
and a goer are different.”

If whatever is going were a goer, it would follow that the actor and the act would be the same
too.

If going and a goer were conceived as different, there could be going without a goer and a goer
without going.

If things are not established as the same and as different, how can they be established?

That very going by which a goer is made evident does not [enable a goer to] go. Because there
is no [goer] before going, who would be going where?

[A going] which is other than the going by which a goer is made evident does not [enable a goer
to] go. Because it is impossible for going to be twofold within a single goer.

One who is a goer does not go in the three aspects of going. Also one who is not [a goer] does
not go in the three aspects of going.

One who is and is not [a goer] also does not go in the three aspects of going. Therefore, going
and a goer and also that which is gone over do not exist.
