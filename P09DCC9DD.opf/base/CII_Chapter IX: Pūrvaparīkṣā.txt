Investigation of the Presence of Something PriorSome say that whatever is involved in seeing,
hearing etc. and feeling etc. exists prior to them.

If [that] thing is not evident, how can there be seeing etc? Therefore, the presence [of that]
thing [must] exist before them.

What configures/makes known that thing which is present before seeing and hearing etc. and feeling
etc.?

If it were present even without seeing etc., there would be no doubt that they would exist even
without it.

It is illuminated by them; they are illuminated by it. How could it exist without them? How
could they exist without it?

It is not evident prior to the totality of seeing etc. From among seeing etc. a different one
illuminates [it] at different times.

If it is not evident prior to the totality of seeing etc., how can it be evident prior to [each
of them] seeing etc. individually?

If the seer itself [were] the hearer and the feeler [were] it too, if it existed prior to each,
in that way it would not make sense.

If the seer were different, the hearer different, the feeler different, at the time the seer
exists, there would be a hearer. Many selves would come about.

Also it is not evident in the elements from which seeing and hearing etc. and feeling etc. occur.

If that to which seeing and hearing etc. and feeling etc. belong is not evident, they too could
not be evident.

Reject the concepts “it exists,” “it doesn’t exist” about that which is not evident prior to,
now or after seeing etc.
