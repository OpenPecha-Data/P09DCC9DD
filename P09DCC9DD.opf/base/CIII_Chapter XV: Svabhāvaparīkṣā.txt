It is unreasonable for an essence to arise from causes and conditions. Whatever essence arose
from causes and conditions would be something that has been made.

How is it possible for there to be “an essence which has been made?” Essences are not contrived
and not dependent on anything else.

If an essence does not exist, how can the thingness of the other exist? [For] the essence of
the thingness of the other is said to be the thingness of the other.

Apart from an essence and the thingness of the other, what things are there? If essences and
thingnesses of others existed, things would be established.

If things were not established, non-things would not be established. [When] a thing becomes
something else, people say that it is a non-thing.

Those who view essence, thingness of the other, things and non-things do not see the suchness
in the teaching of the awakened.

Through knowing things and non-things, the Buddha negated both existence and non-existence in
his Advice to Katyayana.

If [things] existed essentially, they would not come to non-existence. It is never the case
that an essence could become something else.

If essences did not exist, what could become something else? Even if essences existed, what
could become something else?

“Existence” is the grasping at permanence; “non-existence” is the view of annihilation. Therefore,
the wise do not dwell, in existence or non-existence.

“Since that which exists by its essence is not non-existent,” is [the view of] permanence. “That
which arose before is now non-existent,”leads to [the view of] annihilation.
