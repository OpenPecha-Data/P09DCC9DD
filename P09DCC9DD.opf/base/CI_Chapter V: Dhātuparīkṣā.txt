Investigation of the ElementsNot the slightest bit of space exists prior to the characteristics
of space. If [space] existed prior to its characteristics, it would follow that it would
be without characteristics.

A thing without characteristics does not exist anywhere at all. If a thing without characteristics
does not exist, to what do characteristics extend?

Characteristics do not extend to that which has no characteristics; nor to what possesses characteristics.
They also cannot extend to something other than what either possesses or does
not have characteristics.

If characteristics do not extend [to something], something characterized would be impossible.
If something characterized is impossible, characteristics too would not exist.

Therefore, something characterized does not exist and characteristics do not exist. There also
does not exist a thing which is apart from being something characterized or a characteristic.

If there is not a thing, of what can there be a non-thing? By whom are the opposites thing and
non-thing known [as] a thing and a non-thing?

Therefore, space is not a thing; it is not a non-thing; it is not something characterized; it
is not a characteristic. The other five elements too are similar to space.

Those of small minds see things as existent and non-existent. They do not behold the utter pacification
of what is seen.
