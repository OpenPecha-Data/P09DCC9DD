Investigation of the AggregatesApart from the cause of form, form is not perceived. Apart from
“form”, the cause of form also does not appear.

If there were form apart from the cause of form, it would follow that form is without cause;
there is no object at all that is without cause.

If a cause of form existed apart from form, it would exist as a cause without fruit; causes
without fruit do not exist.

If form existed, a cause of form would be untenable; if form did not exist, a cause of form
would be untenable.

Forms which do not have a cause are not at all tenable. Therefore, do not conceive the concept
of form at all.

It is untenable to say, “the fruit is like the cause.” It is also untenable to say, “the fruit
is unlike the cause.”

Feeling and perception, impulses and mind and all things are comparable in every aspect, at
every stage with form.

When having argued by means of emptiness, everything of that one who objects is not an objection;
it is similar to what is to be established .

When having explained by means of emptiness, everything of that one who finds fault is not a
fault; it is similar to what is to be established.
