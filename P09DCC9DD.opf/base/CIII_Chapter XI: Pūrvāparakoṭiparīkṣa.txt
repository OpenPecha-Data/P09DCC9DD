When asked, “is a before-extreme evident?” the great Muni said, “it is not.” Samsara has no
beginning, no end; it has no before, no after.

For that without beginning [and] end, where can a middle be in that? Therefore, it is not possible
for it to have before, after, and simultaneous phases.

If birth were before and aging/death after, there would be birth without aging/death and also
without dying one would be born.

If birth were after and aging/death before, how could there be an uncaused aging/death which
has no birth?

It is not suitable for birth and aging/death to be simultaneous; that which is being born would
be dying and both would be without cause.

Why fixate on that birth, that aging/dying, for which the phases of before, after, simultaneity
are impossible?

It is not just samsara alone that has no before-extreme, cause and fruit themselves, and characteristics
and the basis for characteristics themselves,

feeling and the feeler, whatever is suitable to bear meaning, also all things have no before-extreme.
