In order to become again, those obscured by ignorance are moved into destinies by actions which
are impelled [by] the three kinds of formative impulses.

Consciousness conditioned by formative impulses enters into destinies. When consciousness has
entered, name and form develop.

When name and form develop, the six senses emerge. In dependence upon the six senses, impact
actually occurs.

Just as [it] only arises in dependence on the eye, [visual] form and attention, so consciousness
arises in dependence on name and form.

The gathering of the three: eye and [visual] form and consciousness, that is “impact.” From
impact feeling totally arises.

Due to the condition of feeling, there is craving; one craves for what is felt. When one craves,
one clings to the four aspects of clinging [sense objects, views, morals and rules, and
views of self].

When there is clinging, the becoming of the clinger fully arises. When there is no clinging,
one is freed; there is no [more] becoming.

Becoming is the five aggregates; from becoming one is born. Aging, death, torment, lamentation,
pain,

mental unhappiness, anxiety: these vividly emerge from birth. Likewise, the entire mass of anguish
emerges.

The root of life is formative impulses. Therefore, the wise do not form impulses. Therefore,
the unwise are formers, but not the wise since they see reality.

When ignorance stops, formative impulses too do not occur. The stopping of ignorance [comes]
through practising that with understanding.

By the stopping of the former, the latter will clearly not occur. The entire mass of anguish
will likewise completely stop.
