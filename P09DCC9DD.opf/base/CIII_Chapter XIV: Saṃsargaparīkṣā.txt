The seen, the seeing and the seer: these three do not mutually connect [as] pairs or all [together].

Likewise desire, desiring and the desired, the remaining afflictions and also the remaining
sense-fields do [not connect] by three aspects.

If the other connects to the other, because the seen and so forth do not exist [as] other, therefore
there is no connection.

Not only are the seen and so forth alone not existing as other, it is invalid for anything simultaneous
with something to be other [than it].

The other is other in dependence upon the other. Without the other, the other would not be other.
It is invalid for whatever is dependent on something to be other than that.

If the other was other than the other, then, without the other, it would be other. Without the
other it would not be other. Therefore, it does not exist.

Otherness does not exist in the other. Nor does it exist in what is not other. If otherness
does not exist, neither the other nor that itself exists.

That does not connect with that. The other too does not connect with the other. The connecting,
the connection and the connector too do not exist.
